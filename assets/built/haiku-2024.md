**Ways to make the familiar unfamiliar**

Corner words: i drink the air is growing dry, the mountain i’m sitting on the wind the grass

Garden paths: the fireflies that it rained all day. Is this just a particular kind of corner word?

Unusual prepositions: raindrops until the ground

Juxtaposing different parts of speech: loudly and breath pressed against breath, i walk and buttercups i sit and buttercups

Focusing on a sensation that’s not salient: toes when I’m leaning back on my heels

Repetition: arukeba kimpouge suwareba kimpouge

Omission / hablar alrededoweekr: until my clothes are finally dry, oceans of grass wave in the breeze

Causation games: a weed grew the wind to carry her children

Change the timeline: what happens over a much longer or much shorter timespan than humans usually think

Replace with becoming: replace the noun with the process of what it’s changing into. Sukkari karete mame to natte iru, in this stream the process of becoming lakewater. Could also replace with what it used to be or what it will become, but those are a little less grounded in the present.

Use corner words to show two things are connected or happening at the same time: i said thank you to the housekeeper gave me flowers

(This isn't Leaflet either.)

here from bed about to set off into today

the sour taste of i cleaned my mouth last night

that mountain’s far flattened forest

a morning mountain that i’m putting on my shoes

a cloud blew into my bed

woke up to the garden has grown

in a minute the sun over the ridge 

remembered i’m breathing out my body

soon i’ll smell like outside

me and the chickens starting our day

the door that flowers are flowering

i followed dogs followed me down the mountain

fireflies again where i’m learning to appreciate spiders

the forest but i can’t be a home for fireflies

my house that waters down the forest

dragging water up into the sound of dog calls

it gets cold here if trees go to sleep

cricket sounds who simmer who fizz

predawn remembering the waterblue

woke up with food in my chest and the moment the sun

a young day swooping bugs and birds

morning bounces again off the valley

one and a half birds crossed my window 

yesterday the clouds had broken but

light sprinkled on my wrist skin

the forest and me moving water

when i’ll leave skipping seasons

the world’s work in the sun soaked berries and me

i thought again about a break in the clouds

here in the bathroom that i didn’t eat all day

the street that you can see the mountain’s near sunset

spending time with the hot water here and dishes

at the end of the day the eggplants i was full of

in the dry season my garden is turning into unripe oranges

another fire that smoked and salted this mountain

the bugs of morning through the sunlight

a new wind the past few days

motes and dust on the wind here has a name

new air breathed by bugs breathed by me

a sizzle on the mountain then the wind’s around me

today just the sound of the wind on my shirt

sunlit the cupleaf tree going where i’m going

toasting on this spot between winds

the way this ant stutters when it walks

birds coming closer that i’m still asleep

morning dogs slap a boat on the water

no rain but fresh like it did

no goats here but there’s a bird trying her best

there’s always clouds on the mountain tomato stand

the sound of writing against the mountainside

snoring upstairs but it's just below the horizon

gentle birds left and right a two dogs shouting match

everyday bird chirps and dog chirps

a tree whose warm orange eggs the sun

one line of spider light between the leaves

today seeping out from the garden the valley

the restfulness that it smelled bad but i made new soil

here if there’s dew dried up the morning

wasp tottering through the leafy air

a bird and a bird through the flat white morning

crickets have just one word that is sunset

just washed my face can feel the water in the air

the sound was bird near cut leaves

stumbling and the half-paved path

a vine where the path cuts the canopy

leaf sap grew six legs

here the walk dips brimming with seeds

from this patch of sweet-smelling sky, almost apples

a tree cloud and puddle of fruit

feet flies and squirrels buzzing overhead

into cool air between the earths

fewer trees here in the people warren

downslope the sound was water made to move

it’s hot here with the sun in the black road

over the wallflowers spilling to collect this morning

the plants who season water with sunlight

only when i breathe the smell of the inland sea

the water swallowing the heat of the day

feeling the water wind on my eyes

steps the wood underfoot that moves

more people ringing the bell of the ice seller

out into the water darkened at shore

this mountain slipping into the water

just noticed a tree in the lake

the mountain clouds cooling the mountain

a town of flowers above the town

blue burning the skyline flowers

cooled off the garden sprouting birdcalls 

remembering when i laid in the grass and a spider

young and green but orange when it wants to be eaten

![[3B792B7B-737A-4858-899D-098C990C8524.jpeg]]

on the wind music and lake water

a bird who four croaks and a squiggle

bird words like a spark

my bedroom window without the sun in it

metal to look like a vine

when the air up the mountain gets cold enough

through the air colored those plants

walking down to the waters near sunset

what was it before fruit?

light across the valley fire

fireflies who i’m eating this bread alone

mountain lake water breathed and bathed

pepper green fire bubbles

oh the morning’s here too? // asa mo iru ka

even if i don’t see them the bug bites

up early walking off the mist

cloud cover cloud clover

too dark to see big colors

listening to the way the barks

the cold where hair was

shoulder to shoulder with cricket sounds

bugs eating and eating up

listening to a dog having barked

it’s dark the leaves blend in with the leaves

yesterbirds and the sound of hammering

blinding silver rooftop from underground

in the forest that only birds beep

burned air all the way up here

earth toasting but the breeze

with hands of green lemon smell

hanging berries still just berries

sunlight in the unknown berry taste

a bruise from moving, the nearest mountain

moving the water and weeds but me

where i’m sitting into the lake

mist and mist where’s a cloud?

the waves when the air is dry

a tree’s dead yet room and board

no rain but the sun and a few dry spots

what’s on the rock is the feeling of getting hungry

cold then lightened to shallows

the tree that i’m not sure if it’s dead but it’s still giving shade

dirt at the bottom, dirt in the branches

plants growing plants, like someone from my shoulder

a tree and me, branches and buds, both young and old

small green leaves then it’s not dead

lay down getting grass in my eyes

ant feet and tongues of grass

trees spilling sunstripes

over years, a forest is a fountain

smoke smells mineral somehow

day of trip: 2
where: Tzununá, Guatemala

a mountain, a mountain taller than mountains

inside the folding lands and me

pull back the window when the first plants breath

sucking in my shoulders, not caught on a barbed wire

tires scraping along the road

day of trip: 1
where: Guatemala City, Guatemala

a lot of miles a lot of noise

no seashore, no quiet

the trees here, me burning them brimming

counting the sounds, just one not ours

a breath my eyes open a bouncing branch
